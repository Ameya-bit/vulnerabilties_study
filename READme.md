## This is personal research/study on common web application vulnerabilites

Linked here is the medium article that I got these common vulnerabilities from: https://it4chis3c.medium.com/30-days-30-vulnerabilities-challenge-37912cf76016

To research best practices against these vulnerabilities, I consulted various different resources and built generalized code to just understand the processes
that go into security.
